#Java Design Patterns Demo Projects

This repository contains demo projects showcasing the implementation of different design patterns in Java, including:

Adapter pattern
Abstract factory pattern
Command pattern
Strategy pattern
Decorator pattern
Additionally, there is also a demo project for generics.

All of these projects were completed as tasks for the "Advanced Object-Oriented Programming" course in Java.

#Generics

The task requires creating a Java program that uses generics to create a list of User objects and then shuffles the list. It then needs to create a recursive method that gets all possible pairs from the shuffled list. The User class should be updated to be comparable using the CompareTwo class based on the ID value of the user. Finally, the program should use CompareTwo to compare all pairs from the shuffled list and print the results.
